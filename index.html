      <p class="featured-subtitle">
        In May 1989, Dolly Parton joined Kenny Rogers and Willie Nelson for a live concert at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, performed for thousands of NASA employees and their families and later broadcast nationally as the NBC special <em>"Kenny, Dolly and Willie: Something Inside So Strong."</em>

            During the performance of <em>"Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That,"</em> as the song reaches its final moments, Dolly steps toward the edge of the stage where the crowd is pressed closest. At approximately 30:27 in the televised recording, she leans toward the front row and shares a brief kiss with an audience member — a flicker of contact almost swallowed by the darkness and the grain of the tape.

            Onscreen it lasts less than a second, but it became one of Ray's defining memories of the night. The clip presented here has been carefully restored from the original broadcast while preserving the texture and imperfections of the source.

            <p class="exhibit-description">
              On March 10, 1992, Ray joined Dolly on <em>Good Morning Houston</em>—a quiet studio moment that became one of his proudest memories. This still has been carefully restored from the original photograph.
